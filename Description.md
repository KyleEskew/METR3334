These files exhibit a selection work from METR3334, a course wherein my groupmates and I began to explore the Great Plains Low-Level Jet (GPLLJ). We are particularly interested in connecting changes in the GPLLJ to changes in severe convective weather across the Great Plains. Two of the files involve using the NCEI Storm Events Database. One is a more simple, practice endeavor in subsetting data from the entire dataset. The other is extremely involved, dividing specific tornado occurences into regions; analyzing the count of tornadoes on a per region, per month basis further averaged by year; and creating a map of the regional domains. The last file includes practice dealing with reanalysis data in NetCDF form, for this is something we will have to do plenty next semester during capstone.
